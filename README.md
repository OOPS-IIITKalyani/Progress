Our project model is based in these 4 sub models : -

1. User model which mainly based on age of the patient where we record all the existing diseases (if exist) , and all basic information of the patient
2. Specialist Doctor - They will have full access they can diagonse patient,book appointments and can add to database new diseases
3. Medical Industry People (Compounder, Medical Student, Chemist,etc )- They will have limited access to suggest test, medicine, etc basically they cannot diagonose serious diseases
4. Medical Technician (Lab test, etc) - They will have only medical test access.
